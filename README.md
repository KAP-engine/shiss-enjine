## commands
- `display` displays the chessboard
- `move <x>` plays the move x, the first two chars of x specify the file
and rank of the source square, and the the two last specify the file and
the rank of the destination square, they are **NOT** separated by space. 

## known bugs
1. the issue of capturing moves and non capturing moves is still buggy, since
not all needed verification is done, will fix it later (you know what that
means).
